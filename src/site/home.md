Hi, this is <span class="t3t3">roxwize</span>. I am a nonbinary [purple-ish cat-rabbit](me.html) who sucks at programming. This is my website, and I love you!

This place serves as a repository to store that which piques my interest. Expect me to inject my ramblings into here regularly, as well as put stuff that I've made for you to use/interact with. You can talk to/yell at me on [my Neocities profile](https://neocities.org/site/hoylecake). The source code for the website is on GitHub at [roxwize/roxwize.xyz](https://github.com/roxwize/roxwize.xyz) and on Sourcehut at [~roxwize/roxwize.xyz](https://sr.ht/~roxwize/roxwize.xyz/).

**Remember to press Ctrl+Shift+R** when you visit this website after a day or so. Stuff has probably changed.
